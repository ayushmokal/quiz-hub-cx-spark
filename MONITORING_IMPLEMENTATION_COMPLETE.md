- **ErrorTracker Class**: Enhanced Sentry error handling with logging
- **React Integration**: Error boundaries and profiling components

### üîß Integration Points

#### `src/App.tsx`
- Global Sentry Error Boundary with custom fallback UI
- App initialization performance tracking
- Complete error isolation and recovery

#### `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Authentication performance monitoring
- Login/logout error tracking with context
- User identification for Sentry sessions

#### `src/components/quiz/QuizEngine.tsx`
- Quiz lifecycle performance tracking
- Question-level error monitoring
- Custom metrics for quiz completion

#### `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
- Development-only monitoring test panel
- Real-time verification of monitoring features

### üß™ Testing & Verification

#### Development Test Panel
Located in Dashboard (development mode only):
- ‚úÖ Error tracking verification
- ‚úÖ Performance trace testing
- ‚úÖ API call monitoring
- ‚úÖ Breadcrumb trail testing

### üìà Monitoring Features

#### Firebase Performance
- **Automatic Metrics**: Page load, network requests, app startup
- **Custom Traces**: Quiz completion, authentication flows
- **Business Metrics**: Score tracking, completion rates
- **Environment-Aware**: Different sampling for dev/prod

#### Sentry Error Tracking
- **Error Capture**: JavaScript errors, promise rejections
- **Performance Monitoring**: React component render times
- **Session Replay**: 10% sampling in production, 100% in development
- **Logging Integration**: Console logs automatically captured
- **User Context**: Automatic user identification after login

### üöÄ Production Ready

#### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Proper DSN and Firebase config
- **Sampling Rates**: Optimized for performance vs. coverage
- **Error Filtering**: Development vs. production error handling
- **User Privacy**: PII handling according to Sentry guidelines

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Sentry loads asynchronously
- **Sample Rates**: 10% transaction sampling in production
- **Trace Cleanup**: Automatic trace management and cleanup
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized imports to minimize overhead
