🧪 CX ULTRA QUIZ - INTERCONNECTED LOGIC VALIDATION TESTS

Test Scenarios to Validate:

1. CATEGORY DELETION CASCADE 🗑️
   ✅ Delete category → All topics in category deleted
   ✅ Delete category → All questions in topics deleted  
   ✅ Delete category → Dashboard refreshes automatically
   ✅ Delete category → Topic lists update across all components
   ✅ Delete category → Question counts update
   ✅ Delete category → User stats recalculate

2. GLOBAL STATE SYNCHRONIZATION 🔄
   ✅ CategoryManagement triggers invalidateCategories()
   ✅ Dashboard listens to dashboardNeedsRefresh
   ✅ TopicManagement listens to topicsNeedRefresh  
   ✅ QuestionManagement listens to questionsNeedRefresh
   ✅ All components mark data as fresh after successful load

3. DATA CONSISTENCY VALIDATION 📊
   ✅ Topics only show if status === 'active'
   ✅ Topics only show if they have valid displayName and ID
   ✅ Categories are properly linked to topics
   ✅ Questions are properly linked to topics
   ✅ Quiz attempts are cleaned up when topics deleted

4. UI RESPONSIVENESS 🎯
   ✅ Loading states during operations
   ✅ Error handling with user feedback
   ✅ Success notifications
   ✅ Real-time updates without page refresh
   ✅ Proper cascading without user intervention

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION ⚡
   ✅ Batch operations where possible
   ✅ Debounced refresh triggers
   ✅ Efficient Firestore queries
   ✅ Minimal re-renders with proper dependencies

TESTING WORKFLOW:
================

Step 1: Open Dashboard - Note current topic count
Step 2: Go to Category Management  
Step 3: Create a test category "Test Delete Category"
Step 4: Go to Topic Management - Add topics to test category
Step 5: Go to Question Management - Add questions to test topics
Step 6: Return to Dashboard - Verify new topics appear
Step 7: Return to Category Management - Delete test category
Step 8: Verify Dashboard automatically refreshes
Step 9: Verify topics no longer appear anywhere
Step 10: Check console logs for proper cascade logging

EXPECTED CONSOLE LOGS:
=====================

🗑️ CategoryManagement: Starting category deletion: [name]
🔄 CategoryManagement: Triggering global state invalidation
🗑️ Firebase: Starting cascading delete for category: [id]
🗑️ Firebase: Found X topics to delete in category [id]
🗑️ Firebase: Found X questions to delete in topic [id]
🗑️ Firebase: Found X quiz attempts to delete for topic [id]
✅ Firebase: Successfully completed cascading delete
🔄 GlobalState: Invalidating categories and dependent data
📊 Dashboard: Global state triggered refresh
🔄 Topics: Fetching active topics...
📊 Dashboard: Loaded stats: [updated stats]

If you see all these logs in sequence, the interconnected logic is working! 🎉

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

❌ Dashboard not refreshing? 
   → Check GlobalStateProvider is wrapped around App
   → Check Dashboard useEffect dependencies include dashboardNeedsRefresh

❌ Topics still showing after category delete?
   → Check category matching logic in deleteCategory
   → Check topics.status === 'active' filtering
   → Check Firestore indexes are properly set

❌ Console errors about global state?
   → Check all components import useGlobalState correctly
   → Check GlobalStateProvider is at the right level in App.tsx

❌ Slow performance?
   → Check for infinite re-render loops
   → Check useCallback dependencies are correct
   → Check Firebase query efficiency
