/**
 * 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED - VERIFICATION SCRIPT
 * 
 * FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
 * ==================
 * 
 * 1. ✅ CATEGORY TOPIC COUNT CALCULATION
 *    - Enhanced CategoryManagement.loadData() to actually count topics
 *    - Cross-references topic.category with multiple category identifiers
 *    - Calculates total question count across all topics in category
 *    - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
 * 
 * 2. ✅ DASHBOARD PERMISSIONS ERROR
 *    - Updated Firestore rules to support both 'quizAttempts' and 'quiz_attempts'
 *    - Deployed rules successfully to Firebase
 *    - Enhanced Dashboard error handling with Promise.allSettled
 *    - Dashboard now loads gracefully even if some API calls fail
 * 
 * VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
 * =======================
 * 
 * ✅ Check Category Management:
 *    - "test" category should now show correct topic count (2)
 *    - Other categories should show accurate counts
 *    - Console should show detailed counting logs
 * 
 * ✅ Check Dashboard:
 *    - Should load without "Missing permissions" errors
 *    - Should display topics and stats properly
 *    - Console should show successful API calls
 * 
 * EXPECTED CONSOLE LOGS:
 * ======================
 * 
 * 📊 CategoryManagement: Loading categories with topic/question counts...
 * 📊 CategoryManagement: Loaded categories: [...]
 * 📊 CategoryManagement: All topics for counting: [...]
 * 🔍 CategoryManagement: Checking topic [name] category: [cat] against identifiers: [...]
 * 📊 CategoryManagement: Category "test" has 2 topics
 * 📊 CategoryManagement: Final categories with counts: [...]
 * 
 * 📊 Dashboard: Refreshing data for user: [userId]
 * 📊 Dashboard: Loaded stats: [stats]
 * 📊 Dashboard: Loaded topics: [number]
 * 📊 Dashboard: Recent attempts: [attempts]
 * 
 * TESTING WORKFLOW:
 * =================
 * 
 * 1. Go to Category Management page
 * 2. Verify "test" category shows "2" topics (not 0)
 * 3. Go to Dashboard
 * 4. Verify it loads without permission errors
 * 5. Check console for proper logging
 * 
 * If you see the expected logs and correct counts:
 * ✅ THE FIXES ARE WORKING! 🎉
 * 
 * The interconnected logic is now properly counting and displaying!
