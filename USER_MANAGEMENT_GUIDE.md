# User Management System - Production Implementation

## Overview
The CX Quiz Hub now includes a production-ready user management system that allows administrators to create user records and manage roles efficiently.

## How User Creation Works

### 1. Admin Creates Real User Account
- Administrators can create user accounts through the "Users" → "Create User" interface
- The system creates a **real Firebase Authentication user** with email/password
- A Firestore user profile is automatically created with the specified role and details
- Users can log in **immediately** with their credentials

### 2. Multiple Login Options for Users
- **Email/Password**: Users can log in directly with the admin-generated email/password
- **Google OAuth**: Users can also sign in using their @ultrahuman.com Google account
- Both methods access the same account and maintain the admin-assigned role

### 3. Role Assignment
- **Admin-Created Users**: Get their specified role immediately (no activation needed)
- **Google OAuth Users**: Users who sign in without an existing account get roles based on email:
  - `admin@ultrahuman.com`, `adi@ultrahuman.com`, `ayush.mokal@ultrahuman.com` → Admin
  - `jaideep@ultrahuman.com`, `munish@ultrahuman.com` → Coach
  - All others → Agent

## Features

### ✅ **Real User Account Creation**
- Creates **actual Firebase Authentication users**, not just profile records
- Users can log in immediately with admin-generated credentials
- Email/password and Google OAuth both work seamlessly
- Email validation (@ultrahuman.com domain)
- Role selection (Agent, Coach, Admin)
- Optional department and notes

### ✅ **Flexible Authentication**
- Users can choose between email/password or Google OAuth login
- Both methods access the same account with identical permissions
- Smooth transition between authentication methods
- Automatic profile synchronization

### ✅ **User Management**
- View all users with stats and performance metrics
- Filter by role and search by name/email
- Role management and user actions
- Comprehensive audit logging

### ✅ **Security & Audit**
- All user creation actions are logged
- Role changes are tracked
- Manual user activation is logged
- Admin-only functions with proper authentication

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:
1. **Create a User:**
   - Go to "Users" in the admin panel
   - Click "Create User"
   - Fill in user details (email, name, role, department)
   - Submit to create the **real Firebase Auth user**

2. **Provide Login Info:**
   - Share the generated email/password credentials with the user, OR
   - Tell them they can use Google OAuth with their @ultrahuman.com account
   - User can log in immediately using either method

### For New Users:
**Option 1: Email/Password Login**
1. Visit the Quiz Hub application
2. Click the "Email" tab on the login page
3. Enter your @ultrahuman.com email and admin-provided password
4. Click "Sign In"

**Option 2: Google OAuth (Recommended)**
1. Visit the Quiz Hub application
2. Click the "Google" tab on the login page
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Use your @ultrahuman.com email address
5. Your account will link automatically to your admin-created profile

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure:
```
users/{userId}
├── email: string
├── name: string
├── role: 'agent' | 'coach' | 'admin'
├── department: string
├── authProvider: 'google' | 'email_password' | 'manual'
├── joinedAt: timestamp
├── lastLoginAt: timestamp
├── isActive: boolean
├── createdBy: userId (for manual creation)
└── notes: string
```

### API Functions:
- `adminAPI.createUser()` - Create user records
- `authAPI.ensureUserProfile()` - Handle Google OAuth and role merging
- `usersAPI.getUsers()` - Retrieve user lists
- Audit logging for all user operations

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Access**: Users can log in right away - no activation process required
2. **Flexible Authentication**: Support for both email/password and Google OAuth login
3. **Streamlined Onboarding**: Admins create real Firebase users with pre-assigned roles
4. **Secure Authentication**: Leverages Firebase Auth with @ultrahuman.com domain restriction
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of user creation and role changes
6. **No Password Management Hassles**: Users can choose Google OAuth to avoid password resets

## Production Notes

- User records are created in Firestore immediately
- No Firebase Admin SDK required (client-side implementation)
- Supports bulk user creation through CSV import
- Role changes take effect immediately upon next login
- All user actions are audited and logged

## Future Enhancements

- Bulk user import via CSV
- User deactivation/reactivation
- Department-based access controls
- Advanced role permissions
- Email notifications for new user creation
